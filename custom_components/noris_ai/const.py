# timeout and the SDK's check is structural — a client whose timeout equals the
# httpx default counts as "no timeout given" and is replaced by the SDK's own
# 600 s default. A gateway that accepts the connection and then never answers

# German Kokoro voice mangles English phonetically ("In turn de on in de de

# cleanly. Only verified languages are claimed; over-claiming would produce
# confident, wrong pronunciation rather than an honest failure to match.
